**Abstract**: Blind/low-vision individuals typically use canes to navigate their environments. Canes allow for people to check their immediate walking path,
but nothing beyond or above the floor. Our project intends to provide a hands-free alternative to the cane. Robot vision and distance sensors
are combined to create a map of the space in front of the user. This map is then projected on to a vest lined with vibrating motors. Similar
alternatives are either uncomfortable (containing several distance sensors), are not hands-free, or rely on complicated machinery.
